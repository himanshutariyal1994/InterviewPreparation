# Challenge 3: Find Two Numbers that Add up to "k"

Given a list and a number "k", find two numbers from the list that sum to "k".

## Problem Statement

In this problem, you have to implement the `find_sum(lst,k)` function which will take a number k as input and return two numbers that add up to k.

Note: In case there is more than one pair in the array containing numbers that add up to value, you are required to return only one such pair. If no such pair found then simply return false.

## Input

A list and a number `k`

## Output

A list with two integers `a` and `b` that add up to `k`

## Sample Input

```python
lst = [1,21,3,14,5,60,7,6]
k = 81
```

## Sample Output

```python
lst = [21,60]
```
