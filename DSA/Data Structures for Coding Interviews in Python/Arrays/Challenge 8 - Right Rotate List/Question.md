# Challenge 8: Right Rotate List

Given a list, can you rotate its elements by one index from right to left? Implement your solution in Python and see if your code runs successfully!

## Problem Statement

Implement a function `right_rotate(lst, k)` which will rotate the given list by k. This means that the right-most elements will appear at the left-most position in the list and so on. You only have to rotate the list by one element at a time.

## Input:

A list and a positive number by which to rotate that list

## Output:

The given list rotated by k elements

## Sample Input

```
lst = [10,20,30,40,50]
k = 3
```

## Sample Output#

> lst = [30,40,50,10,20]
