# Challenge 6: Detect Loop in Linked List

## Problem Statement

A loop is formed when a node in your linked list points to a previously traversed node. Implement the `detect_loop()` function which will take a linked list as input and deduce whether or not a loop is present.

## Input

A singly linked list.

## Output

Returns `True` if the given linked list contains a loop. Otherwise, it returns `False`

## Sample Input

> Linked List = 7->14->21->7

## Sample Output

> True
