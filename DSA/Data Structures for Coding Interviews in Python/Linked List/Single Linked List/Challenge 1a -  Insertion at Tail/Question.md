# Challenge 1a: Insertion at Tail

Now, we'll tackle the second insertion strategy in linked lists.

## Problem Statement

Just as heads and tails are polar opposites, this function is the opposite of what we saw in the last lesson. However, it is just as simple.

> Create a method named `insert_at_tail(data)` for inserting the new object at the end of the linked list. You can naturally guess, that this newly added node will point to `None` as it is at the tail.

## Input

A linked list and an integer value.

## Output

The updated linked list with the value inserted.

## Sample Input

> Linked List = 0->1->2
> data = 3

## Sample Output

> Linked List = 0->1->2->3
