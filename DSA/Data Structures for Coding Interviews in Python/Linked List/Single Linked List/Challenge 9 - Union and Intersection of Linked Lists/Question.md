# Challenge 9: Union & Intersection of Linked Lists

`Union`
Given two lists, A and B, the `union` is the list that contains elements or objects that belong to either A, B, or to both.

`Intersection`
Given two lists, A and B, the `intersection` is the largest list which contains all the elements that are common to both the sets.

The `union` function will take two linked lists and return their union.

The `intersection` function will return all the elements that are common between two linked lists.

## Input

Two linked lists.

## Output

A list containing the union of the two lists.
A list containing the intersection of the two lists.

## Sample Input

> list1 = 10->20->80->60
> list2 = 15->20->30->60->45

## Sample Output

> union = 10->20->80->60->15->30->45
> intersection = 20->60
