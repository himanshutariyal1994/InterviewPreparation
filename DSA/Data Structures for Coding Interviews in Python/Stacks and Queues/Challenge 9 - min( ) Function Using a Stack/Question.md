# Challenge 9: min( ) Function Using a Stack

Using your knowledge, create an efficient min() function using a stack.

## Problem Statement

You have to implement the `MinStack` class which will have a `min()` function. Whenever `min()` is called, the minimum value of the stack is returned in `O(1)` time. The element is not popped from the stack. Its value is simply returned.

## Input

`min()` operates on an object of `MinStack` and doesnâ€™t take any input

## Output

Returns minimum number in `O(1)` time

## Sample Input

> min_stack = [9, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5]

## Sample Output

1
