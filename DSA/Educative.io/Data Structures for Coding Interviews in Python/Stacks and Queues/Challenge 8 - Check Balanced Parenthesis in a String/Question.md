# Challenge 8: Check Balanced Parentheses Using Stack

Check if parentheses in a given expression are balanced or not.

## Problem Statement

In this problem, you have to implement the `is_balanced()` function which will take a string containing only `curly {}, square [], and round () parentheses`. The function will tell us whether all the parentheses in the string are balanced or not.

For all the parentheses to be balanced, every opening parenthesis must have a closing one. The order in which they appear also matters. For example, {[]} is balanced, but {[}] is not.

## Input

A string consisting solely of (, ), {, }, [, and ]

## Output

It returns `True` if the expression contains balanced parentheses and returns `False` otherwise.

## Sample Input

> exp = "{[({})]}"

## Sample Output

True
