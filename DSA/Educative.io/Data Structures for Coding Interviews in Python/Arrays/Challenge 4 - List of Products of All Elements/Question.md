# Challenge 4: List of Products of all Elements

Given a list, modify it so that each index stores the product of all elements in the list except the element at the index itself.

## Problem Statement

Implement a function, `find_product(lst)`, which modifies a list so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the list except the number stored at that index.

## Input

An array of numbers (can even be floats, integers, and negative!)

## Output

An array such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the array except the number stored at that index.

## Sample Input

```python
arr = [1,2,3,4]
```

## Sample Output

```python
arr = [24,12,8,6]
```
